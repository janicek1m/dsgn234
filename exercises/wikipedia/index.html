    <h1>Light</h1>
    <article class="intro">
      <p>
        Light or visible light is electromagnetic radiation within the portion
        of the electromagnetic spectrum that is perceived by the human eye.
        Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of
        400–700 nanometres (nm), between the infrared (with longer wavelengths)
        and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a
        frequency range of roughly 430–750 terahertz (THz).
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary properties of visible light are
        intensity, propagation-direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum and
        polarization. Its speed in a vacuum, 299 792 458 metres a second (m/s),
        is one of the fundamental constants of nature, as with all types of
        electromagnetic radiation (EMR), light is found in experimental
        conditions to always move at this speed in a vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
        In physics, the term 'light' sometimes refers to electromagnetic
        radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense,
        gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. Like all
        types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates as waves.
        However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single
        locations the way particles are absorbed. The absorbed energy of the
        electromagnetic waves is called a photon and represents the quanta of
        light. When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the
        energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location and this
        location is where the photon "arrives". This is what is called the wave
        function collapse. This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light
        is known as the wave–particle duality. The study of light, known as
        optics, is an important research area in modern physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main source of light on Earth is the Sun. Historically, another
        important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient
        campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric
        lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced
        firelight.

      <h2>Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light</h2>
      <p>
        Generally, EM radiation (the designation "radiation" excludes static
        electric, magnetic and near fields), or EMR, is classified by wavelength
        into radio waves, microwaves, infrared, the visible spectrum that we
        perceive as light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays.
      </p>
      <p>
        The behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have
        shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths. When
        EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on
        the amount of energy per quantum it carries.
      </p>
      <p>
        EMR in the visible light region consists of quanta (called photons) that
        are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing
        electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the
        bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible
        light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its
        photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting
        molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule
        retinal in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of
        vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various sources define visible light as narrowly as 420–680 nm to as
        broadly as 380–800 nm. Under ideal laboratory conditions, people can see
        infrared up to at least 1,050 nm;children and young adults may perceive
        ultraviolet wavelengths down to about 310–313 nm.

      <h2>Light sources</h2>
      <p>
        There are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a
        characteristic spectrum of black-body radiation. A simple thermal source
        is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the chromosphere of the Sun at
        around 6,000 kelvins (5,730 degrees Celsius; 10,340 degrees Fahrenheit)
        peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted
        in wavelength units and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the
        ground is visible. Another example is incandescent light bulbs, which
        emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder
        as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing
        solid particles in flames, but these also emit most of their radiation
        in the infrared and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
        The peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10
        micrometre wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As
        the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths,
        producing first a red glow, then a white one and finally a blue-white
        colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and
        into the ultraviolet. These colours can be seen when metal is heated to
        "red hot" or "white hot". Blue-white thermal emission is not often seen,
        except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a gas flame or a
        welder's torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH
        radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425 nm and is not seen in
        stars or pure thermal radiation).
      </p>
      <p>
        Atoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces
        "emission lines" in the spectrum of each atom. Emission can be
        spontaneous, as in light-emitting diodes, gas discharge lamps (such as
        neon lamps and neon signs, mercury-vapor lamps, etc.) and flames (light
        from the hot gas itself—so, for example, sodium in a gas flame emits
        characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be stimulated, as in a
        laser or a microwave maser.

      <h2>Units and measures</h2>
      <p>
        Light is measured with two main alternative sets of units: radiometry
        consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while
        photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a
        standardized model of human brightness perception. Photometry is useful,
        for example, to quantify Illumination (lighting) intended for human use.
        The SI units for both systems are summarized in the following tables.

        The photometry units are different from most systems of physical units
        in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The
        cone cells in the human eye are of three types which respond differently
        across the visible spectrum and the cumulative response peaks at a
        wavelength of around 555 nm. Therefore, two sources of light which
        produce the same intensity (W/m2) of visible light do not necessarily
        appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this
        into account and therefore are a better representation of how "bright" a
        light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw power by a
        quantity called luminous efficacy and are used for purposes like
        determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various
        tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a
        photocell sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by
        the human eye and without filters which may be costly, photocells and
        charge-coupled devices (CCD) tend to respond to some infrared,
        ultraviolet or both.

      <h2>Historical theories about light, in chronological order</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Classical Greece and Hellenism</h3>
        <p>
          In the fifth century BC, Empedocles postulated that everything was
          composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed
          that Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that
          she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight
          possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just
          as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction
          between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          In about 300 BC, Euclid wrote Optica, in which he studied the
          properties of light. Euclid postulated that light travelled in
          straight lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied
          them mathematically. He questioned that sight is the result of a beam
          from the eye, for he asks how one sees the stars immediately, if one
          closes one's eyes, then opens them at night. If the beam from the eye
          travels infinitely fast this is not a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 55 BC, Lucretius, a Roman who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek
          atomists, wrote that "The light & heat of the sun; these are composed
          of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in
          shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted
          by the shove." (from On the nature of the Universe). Despite being
          similar to later particle theories, Lucretius's views were not
          generally accepted. Ptolemy (c. 2nd century) wrote about the
          refraction of light in his book Optics.

        <h3>Classical India</h3>
        <p>
          In ancient India, the Hindu schools of Samkhya and Vaisheshika, from
          around the early centuries AD developed theories on light. According
          to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental "subtle"
          elements (tanmatra) out of which emerge the gross elements. The
          atomicity of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it
          appears that they were actually taken to be continuous. On the other
          hand, the Vaisheshika school gives an atomic theory of the physical
          world on the non-atomic ground of ether, space and time. (See Indian
          atomism.) The basic atoms are those of earth (prthivi), water (pani),
          fire (agni) and air (vayu) Light rays are taken to be a stream of high
          velocity of tejas (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit
          different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements
          of the tejas atoms. The Vishnu Purana refers to sunlight as "the seven
          rays of the sun".
        </p>
        <p>
          The Indian Buddhists, such as Dignāga in the 5th century and
          Dharmakirti in the 7th century, developed a type of atomism that is a
          philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are
          momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an
          atomic entity equivalent to energy.

        <h3>Particle theory</h3>
        <p>
          Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655), an atomist, proposed a particle theory of
          light which was published posthumously in the 1660s. Isaac Newton
          studied Gassendi's work at an early age and preferred his view to
          Descartes' theory of the plenum. He stated in his Hypothesis of Light
          of 1675 that light was composed of corpuscles (particles of matter)
          which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's
          arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known
          to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight
          lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the diffraction of
          light (which had been observed by Francesco Grimaldi) by allowing that
          a light particle could create a localised wave in the aether
        </p>
        <p>
          Newton's theory could be used to predict the reflection of light, but
          could only explain refraction by incorrectly assuming that light
          accelerated upon entering a denser medium because the gravitational
          pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in
          his Opticks of 1704. His reputation helped the particle theory of
          light to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of
          light led Laplace to argue that a body could be so massive that light
          could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now
          called a black hole. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a
          wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light
          (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully
          correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in The
          large scale structure of space-time, by Stephen Hawking and George F.
          R. Ellis.

        <h3>Wave theory</h3>
        <p>
          To explain the origin of colours, Robert Hooke (1635–1703) developed a
          "pulse theory" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in
          water in his 1665 work Micrographia ("Observation IX"). In 1672 Hooke
          suggested that light's vibrations could be perpendicular to the
          direction of propagation. Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) worked out a
          mathematical wave theory of light in 1678 and published it in his
          Treatise on light in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all
          directions as a series of waves in a medium called the luminiferous
          aether. As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they
          slowed down upon entering a denser medium.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each
          other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by Thomas Young). Young
          showed by means of a diffraction experiment that light behaved as
          waves. He also proposed that different colours were caused by
          different wavelengths of light and explained colour vision in terms of
          three-coloured receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave
          theory was Leonhard Euler. He argued in Nova theoria lucis et colorum
          (1746) that diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave
          theory. In 1816 André-Marie Ampère gave Augustin-Jean Fresnel an idea
          that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if
          light were a transverse wave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light
          and presented it to the Académie des Sciences in 1817. Siméon Denis
          Poisson added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing
          argument in favor of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's
          corpuscular theory.By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via
          mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave
          theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse, with no
          longitudinal vibration whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Newton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in
          a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied
          the opposite. At that time, the speed of light could not be measured
          accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to
          make a sufficiently accurate measurement was Léon Foucault, in 1850.
          His result supported the wave theory and the classical particle theory
          was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century.

        <h3>Electromagnetic theory</h3>
        <p>
          In 1845, Michael Faraday discovered that the plane of polarization of
          linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along
          the magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent
          dielectric, an effect now known as Faraday rotation. This was the
          first evidence that light was related to electromagnetism. In 1846 he
          speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating
          along magnetic field lines. Faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a
          high-frequency electromagnetic vibration, which could propagate even
          in the absence of a medium such as the ether.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faraday's work inspired James Clerk Maxwell to study electromagnetic
          radiation and light. Maxwell discovered that self-propagating
          electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed,
          which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light.
          From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic
          radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in On Physical Lines of
          Force. In 1873, he published A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism,
          which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of
          electric and magnetic fields, still known as Maxwell's equations. Soon
          after, Heinrich Hertz confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by
          generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory and
          demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light,
          exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction and
          interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to
          the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic
          imaging and wireless communications.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the quantum theory, photons are seen as wave packets of the waves
          described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was
          needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's
          classical theory could not (such as spectral lines).

        <h3>Quantum theory</h3>
        <p>
          In 1900 Max Planck, attempting to explain black-body radiation,
          suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or
          lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck
          called these "lumps" of light energy "quanta" (from a Latin word for
          "how much"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to
          explain the photoelectric effect and suggested that these light quanta
          had a "real" existence. In 1923 Arthur Holly Compton showed that the
          wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from
          electrons (so called Compton scattering) could be explained by a
          particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 Gilbert N.
          Lewis named these light quanta particles photons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually the modern theory of quantum mechanics came to picture
          light as (in some sense) both a particle and a wave and (in another
          sense), as a phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave (which
          actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves).
          Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described
          sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic
          metaphor (particles) and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water
          waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in
          the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton
          scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends
          to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more
          like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely
          loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies
          a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be
          describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.
        </p>
        <p>
          In February 2018, scientists reported, for the first time, the
          discovery of a new form of light, which may involve polaritons, that
          could be useful in the development of quantum computers.

      <h2>Use for light on Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Sunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars
        mostly in the form of starches, which release energy into the living
        things that digest them. This process of photosynthesis provides
        virtually all the energy used by living things. Some species of animals
        generate their own light, a process called bioluminescence. For example,
        fireflies use light to locate mates and vampire squid use it to hide
        themselves from prey.
