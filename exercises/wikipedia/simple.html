      <h1>Light</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="intro">
      Light or visible light is electromagnetic radiation within the portion of
      the electromagnetic spectrum that is perceived by the human eye. Visible
      light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700
      nanometres (nm), between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the
      ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency
      range of roughly 430–750 terahertz (THz). <br />

      Fondachelli-Fantina, Sicily The primary properties of visible light are
      intensity, propagation-direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum and
      polarization. Its speed in a vacuum, 299 792 458 metres a second (m/s), is
      one of the fundamental constants of nature, as with all types of
      electromagnetic radiation (EMR), light is found in experimental conditions
      to always move at this speed in a vacuum. <br />
      In physics, the term 'light' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation
      of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma rays,
      X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. Like all types of
      electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates as waves. However, the
      energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way
      particles are absorbed. The absorbed energy of the electromagnetic waves
      is called a photon and represents the quanta of light. When a wave of
      light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave
      instantly collapses to a single location and this location is where the
      photon "arrives". This is what is called the wave function collapse. This
      dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the
      wave–particle duality. The study of light, known as optics, is an
      important research area in modern physics. <br />
      The main source of light on Earth is the Sun. Historically, another
      important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires
      to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric lights and
      power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight.

      <h2>Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light</h2>
      <p class="content">
        Generally, EM radiation (the designation "radiation" excludes static
        electric, magnetic and near fields), or EMR, is classified by wavelength
        into radio waves, microwaves, infrared, the visible spectrum that we
        perceive as light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays.
        <br />
        The behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have
        shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths. When
        EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on
        the amount of energy per quantum it carries.
        <br />
        EMR in the visible light region consists of quanta (called photons) that
        are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing
        electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the
        bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible
        light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its
        photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting
        molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule
        retinal in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of
        vision.
        <br />
        There exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but
        not by means of quantum-absorption. Infrared sensing in snakes depends
        on a kind of natural thermal imaging, in which tiny packets of cellular
        water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this
        range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these
        animals detect it.
        <br />
        Above the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to
        humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 nm and the
        internal lens below 400 nm. Furthermore, the rods and cones located in
        the retina of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360 nm)
        ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet. Many
        animals with eyes that do not require lenses (such as insects and
        shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by quantum photon-absorption
        mechanisms, in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible
        light.
        <br />
        Various sources define visible light as narrowly as 420–680 nm to as
        broadly as 380–800 nm. Under ideal laboratory conditions, people
        can see infrared up to at least 1,050 nm;children and young adults may
        perceive ultraviolet wavelengths down to about 310–313 nm.
        <br />
        Plant growth is also affected by the colour spectrum of light, a process
        known as photomorphogenesis.

      <h2>Light sources</h2>
      <p class="content">
        There are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a
        characteristic spectrum of black-body radiation. A simple thermal source
        is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the chromosphere of the Sun at
        around 6,000 kelvins (5,730 degrees Celsius; 10,340 degrees Fahrenheit)
        peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted
        in wavelength units and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches
        the ground is visible. Another example is incandescent light bulbs,
        which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the
        remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the
        glowing solid particles in flames, but these also emit most of their
        radiation in the infrared and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.
        <br />
        The peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10
        micrometre wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As
        the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths,
        producing first a red glow, then a white one and finally a blue-white
        colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and
        into the ultraviolet. These colours can be seen when metal is heated to
        "red hot" or "white hot". Blue-white thermal emission is not often seen,
        except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a gas flame or a
        welder's torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH
        radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425 nm and is not seen in
        stars or pure thermal radiation). <br />
        Atoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces
        "emission lines" in the spectrum of each atom. Emission can be
        spontaneous, as in light-emitting diodes, gas discharge lamps (such as
        neon lamps and neon signs, mercury-vapor lamps, etc.) and flames (light
        from the hot gas itself—so, for example, sodium in a gas flame emits
        characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be stimulated, as in a
        laser or a microwave maser. <br />
        Deceleration of a free charged particle, such as an electron, can
        produce visible radiation: cyclotron radiation, synchrotron radiation
        and bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving
        through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can
        produce visible Cherenkov radiation. Certain chemicals produce visible
        radiation by chemoluminescence. In living things, this process is called
        bioluminescence. For example, fireflies produce light by this means and
        boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing
        wake. <br />
        Certain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more
        energetic radiation, a process known as fluorescence. Some substances
        emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is
        known as phosphorescence. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited
        by bombarding them with subatomic particles. Cathodoluminescence is one
        example. This mechanism is used in cathode ray tube television sets and
        computer monitors. <br>

        <h2>Units and measures</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Light is measured with two main alternative sets of units: radiometry consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception. Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify Illumination (lighting) intended for human use. The SI units for both systems are summarized in the following tables.
        </p>
        <h3>Table 1. SI radiometry units</h3>
        <h1>INSERT HTML TABLE HERE LATER</h1>
        <h3>Table 2. SI photometry quantities</h3>
        <h1>INSERT HTML TABLE HERE LATER</h1>
        <p class="content">
          The photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The cone cells in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555 nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m2) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account and therefore are a better representation of how "bright" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw power by a quantity called luminous efficacy and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a photocell sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye and without filters which may be costly, photocells and charge-coupled devices (CCD) tend to respond to some infrared, ultraviolet or both.

      <h2>Historical theories about light, in chronological order</h2>
      <h3>Classical Greece and Hellenism</h3>
      <p class="content">
        In the fifth century BC, Empedocles postulated that everything was composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun. <br>
        In about 300 BC, Euclid wrote Optica, in which he studied the properties of light. Euclid postulated that light travelled in straight lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied them mathematically. He questioned that sight is the result of a beam from the eye, for he asks how one sees the stars immediately, if one closes one's eyes, then opens them at night. If the beam from the eye travels infinitely fast this is not a problem. <br>
        In 55 BC, Lucretius, a Roman who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek atomists, wrote that "The light & heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove." (from On the nature of the Universe). Despite being similar to later particle theories, Lucretius's views were not generally accepted. Ptolemy (c. 2nd century) wrote about the refraction of light in his book Optics.

      <h3>Classical India</h3>
      <p class="content">
        In ancient India, the Hindu schools of Samkhya and Vaisheshika, from around the early centuries AD developed theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental "subtle" elements (tanmatra) out of which emerge the gross elements. The atomicity of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be continuous. On the other hand, the Vaisheshika school gives an atomic theory of the physical world on the non-atomic ground of ether, space and time. (See Indian atomism.) The basic atoms are those of earth (prthivi), water (pani), fire (agni) and air (vayu) Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of tejas (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the tejas atoms. The Vishnu Purana refers to sunlight as "the seven rays of the sun".<br>
        The Indian Buddhists, such as Dignāga in the 5th century and Dharmakirti in the 7th century, developed a type of atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy.
      </p>

      <h3>Descartes</h3>
      <p class="content">
        René Descartes (1596–1650) held that light was a mechanical property of the luminous body, rejecting the "forms" of Ibn al-Haytham and Witelo as well as the "species" of Bacon, Grosseteste and Kepler. In 1637 he published a theory of the refraction of light that assumed, incorrectly, that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium. Descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of sound waves. Although Descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds, he was correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media.<br>
        Descartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes' theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.
      </p>

      <h3>Particle theory</h3>
      <p class="content">
        Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655), an atomist, proposed a particle theory of light which was published posthumously in the 1660s. Isaac Newton studied Gassendi's work at an early age and preferred his view to Descartes' theory of the plenum. He stated in his Hypothesis of Light of 1675 that light was composed of corpuscles (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the diffraction of light (which had been observed by Francesco Grimaldi) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the aether.<br>
        Newton's theory could be used to predict the reflection of light, but could only explain refraction by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser medium because the gravitational pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his Opticks of 1704. His reputation helped the particle theory of light to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led Laplace to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a black hole. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in The large scale structure of space-time, by Stephen Hawking and George F. R. Ellis. <br>
        The fact that light could be polarized was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. Étienne-Louis Malus in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. Jean-Baptiste Biot in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.

      <h3>Wave theory</h3>
      <p class="content">
        To explain the origin of colours, Robert Hooke (1635–1703) developed a "pulse theory" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work Micrographia ("Observation IX"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678 and published it in his Treatise on light in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the luminiferous aether. As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.<br>
        The wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by Thomas Young). Young showed by means of a diffraction experiment that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different colours were caused by different wavelengths of light and explained colour vision in terms of three-coloured receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was Leonhard Euler. He argued in Nova theoria lucis et colorum (1746) that diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 André-Marie Ampère gave Augustin-Jean Fresnel an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a transverse wave.<br>
        Later, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light and presented it to the Académie des Sciences in 1817. Siméon Denis Poisson added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favor of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's corpuscular theory.By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.<br>
        The weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance luminiferous aether proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the Michelson–Morley experiment.<br>
        Newton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the speed of light could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was Léon Foucault, in 1850. His result supported the wave theory and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century.

      <h3>Electromagnetic theory</h3>
      <p class="content">
        In 1845, Michael Faraday discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent dielectric, an effect now known as Faraday rotation. This was the first evidence that light was related to electromagnetism. In 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines. Faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a high-frequency electromagnetic vibration, which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether.<br>
        Faraday's work inspired James Clerk Maxwell to study electromagnetic radiation and light. Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in On Physical Lines of Force. In 1873, he published A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still known as Maxwell's equations. Soon after, Heinrich Hertz confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging and wireless communications.<br>
        In the quantum theory, photons are seen as wave packets of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as spectral lines).<br>

      <h3>Quantum theory</h3>
      <p class="content">
        In 1900 Max Planck, attempting to explain black-body radiation, suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these "lumps" of light energy "quanta" (from a Latin word for "how much"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the photoelectric effect and suggested that these light quanta had a "real" existence. In 1923 Arthur Holly Compton showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called Compton scattering) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 Gilbert N. Lewis named these light quanta particles photons.<br>
        Eventually the modern theory of quantum mechanics came to picture light as (in some sense) both a particle and a wave and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles) and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.<br>
        In February 2018, scientists reported, for the first time, the discovery of a new form of light, which may involve polaritons, that could be useful in the development of quantum computers.

      <h2>Use for light on Earth</h2>
      <p class="content">
        Sunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies use light to locate mates and vampire squid use it to hide themselves from prey.
