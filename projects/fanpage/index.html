              <h3>Pokémon Red and Blue</h3>
              <p>
                As the Game Boy only supported 2-bit colors and 8-bit graphics,
                Pikachu was displayed in black and white with pixel graphics in
                the original Pokémon Red and Blue games. Pikachu was chosen as
                the primary mascot of the game in an attempt to appeal to female
                viewers and their mothers because it was believed that Pikachu
                presented the image of a recognizable pet to children.

              <h3>Pokémon Gold and Silver</h3>
              <p>
                Pokémon Gold and Silver were the first of the Pokémon games to
                be introduced in color with the development of the Game Boy
                Color, which featured a color screen with 15-bit RGB color
                graphics. Pikachu's color was finalized to be yellow, as yellow
                is a primary color and easier for children to recognize from a
                distance.

              <h3>Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</h3>
              <p>
                In 2002, Pokémon came to the Game Boy Advance in full color and
                made significant strides toward enhancing game mechanics and
                technology that were not possible in previous versions. While
                still limited to 15-bit RGB color graphics, greater resolution
                allowed for a full-color, more detailed Pikachu with red
                circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with
                electricity.

              <h3>Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</h3>
              <p>
                Pokémon Diamond and Pearl were the first games released on the
                Nintendo DS, which supported 8 times as many colors as the Game
                Boy Advance or Game Boy Color. Pikachu now appeared more
                3D-like, with the ability to support different shades of yellows
                and browns allowing to create shading and shadows on the form.
                Greater resolution also supported more complex movement.

              <h3>Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</h3>
              <p>
                Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire were the first versions to
                reveal 3D graphics with the development of the Nintendo 3DS, a
                massive change to the franchise’s video game graphic design.
                Pikachu is now fully 3D and is designed with multiple camera
                angles and perspectives in mind. A single frame on the 3DS main
                display is 400 x 240 pixels compared to a single frame from the
                DS being 256 x 192 pixels. As a result, Pikachu is designed with
                smoother lines and curves.

              <h3>Pokémon Go</h3>
              <p>
                Taking the world by storm, by blurring the line between reality
                and the digital world, Pokémon Go introduced the most realistic
                Pikachu design yet in order to create a highly immersive virtual
                experience using augmented reality. There are no visible
                pixels--housed on mobile devices, Pikachu is displayed in higher
                frame rates, allowing for smoother animations.
